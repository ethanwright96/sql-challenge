-- Check associated tables
-- SELECT * FROM employees;
-- SELECT * FROM salaries;

SELECT e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, e.sex, s.salary
FROM employees e, salaries s
WHERE e.emp_no=s.emp_no
ORDER BY e.emp_no;

-- Note: emp_no is the PK of employees.

-- 2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date between '1986-01-01' AND '1986-12-31'
ORDER BY hire_date

-- Note: between is used here instead of (in)equality tests because hire_date is a DATE object.

-- 3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

SELECT d.dept_no, d.dept_name, dm.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name
FROM departments d, dept_manager dm, employees e
WHERE d.dept_no = dm.dept_no
AND dm.emp_no = e.emp_no
ORDER BY d.dept_no;

-- 4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

SELECT de.dept_no, de.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, d.dept_name
FROM dept_emp de, employees e, departments d
WHERE de.dept_no = d.dept_no
AND de.emp_no = e.emp_no
ORDER BY de.dept_no;

-- Note: three tables are related here. 

-- List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

SELECT first_name, last_name, sex
FROM employees 
WHERE first_name in ('Hercules')
AND last_name like ('B%');
